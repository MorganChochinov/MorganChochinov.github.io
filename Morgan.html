 I feel like this image prepresents me, because I have been playing baseball my <em>whole life.</em> <br> Baseball is the only sport I have played in a league, and I have enjoyed it for these past <strong>eight years</strong>.
<br> I didn't play baseball at a supe high level till this year, but making it to <strong>Triple A</strong> has helped me get better at baseball.<br> We had a tournament in Guelph, and we were the best fall ball team.<br> That tournament really helped me showcase my skill infront of my coaches.  Skill wise, and showing if I was a team leader.

<h1>Things that High level baseball will help me with.</h1>
<ol>
<li> Stress.
<li> Get better.
<li> Get fit.
<li> Team leader skill.   
<li> Get a new family.
